    <h2>Origin</h2>
    <p>
      The <b>Aswang</b> is one of the most notorious and feared supernatural beings in Philippine mythology. A shapeshifter by nature, the Aswang can take many forms — from a beautiful woman by day to a monstrous creature by night. The term "aswang" is an umbrella for various vampiric, ghoul-like, and witch entities that prey on the weak, particularly children and the sick. <br><br>
      Originating in the Visayan regions, stories of the Aswang have been passed through generations and are deeply rooted in local folklore. Spanish colonizers even recorded native fears and descriptions of these creatures as early as the 16th century. The legend likely evolved from pre-colonial beliefs about evil spirits and dark sorcery, growing more sinister under colonial influences and Catholic demonization of indigenous traditions.

    <h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
    <p>
      The Aswang legend reflects deep societal fears — the unseen dangers lurking in rural towns, and the hidden nature of evil. Its ability to blend into society by day and transform into a predator by night made it a symbol of mistrust and betrayal. <br><br>
      In many communities, suspicions about someone being an Aswang could lead to isolation or violence. The creature’s association with sickness and death made it an explanation for unexplained illnesses or infant deaths in early villages. Villagers believed garlic, salt, and religious symbols could ward it off, and folklore describes rituals to identify or eliminate one living among them. <br><br>
      The Aswang is often used in cautionary tales to deter children from wandering at night or misbehaving. It also underscores the importance of community vigilance and the dangers of social alienation. Its role in Philippine folklore continues to inform the country’s horror literature and cinema.

    <h2>Modern Interpretation</h2>
    <p>
      Today, the Aswang is not just a horror icon but also a metaphor for hidden dangers, duality, and fear of the unknown. In modern media, the Aswang has appeared in films, comic books, and TV series, reimagined with new depth and meaning. <br><br>
      Creators have used the Aswang to represent themes like repression, colonial trauma, or moral ambiguity. In pop culture, the Aswang is both monster and metaphor — seen in shows like "Trese" and films such as "Tiktik: The Aswang Chronicles." <br><br>
      Despite technological advancements and modern skepticism, many Filipinos in rural areas still believe in the Aswang, especially during unexplained tragedies or mysterious sightings. It remains one of the most enduring and culturally significant figures in Philippine mythology.
