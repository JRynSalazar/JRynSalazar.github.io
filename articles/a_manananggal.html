        <h1>Manananggal: The Winged Terror of the Night</h1>
        <p>Exploring the mystery of the terrifying self-segmenting creature in Philippine folklore</p>
      </header>

      <div class="content">
        <h2>Origin</h2>
        <p>
          The <b>Manananggal</b> is one of the most feared creatures in Philippine folklore. Its name comes from the Tagalog word "tanggal," meaning "to remove" or "to separate," referring to its ability to sever its upper torso and sprout bat-like wings to fly into the night.
          <br><br>
          Early accounts of similar creatures were documented during the Spanish colonization of the Philippines. Spanish friars recorded stories of beings that preyed on humans, especially pregnant women, drinking their blood and consuming their internal organs. 
          <br><br>
          Although there are many regional variations, the Manananggal is usually depicted as a beautiful woman by day, transforming at night into a horrifying monster with fangs, clawed hands, and enormous wings. It leaves its lower half behind, often hidden in secluded areas, while the upper body hunts for prey.
          <br><br>
          The Manananggal is often compared to European vampires, though its methods and transformation are unique to Filipino mythology. Folk stories emphasize using salt, garlic, ash, or crushed garlic to prevent the creature from rejoining its lower half, effectively killing it before sunrise.
        </p>

        <h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
        <p>
          The <b>Manananggal</b> holds a dark and fascinating place in Filipino culture. More than just a monster, it symbolizes fears surrounding betrayal, hidden dangers, and the unknown, particularly in rural communities.
          <br><br>
          In the countryside, tales of the Manananggal were often used to caution young women and children to avoid wandering alone at night. It also served as a metaphor for societal anxieties: fear of illness, death during childbirth, and the predatory nature of the world.
          <br><br>
          The Manananggal is also seen as an inversion of womanhood—subverting the nurturing, protective image of women into something monstrous. In this way, the legend addresses complex themes like trust, transformation, and danger lurking beneath familiar faces.
          <br><br>
          Across generations, this creature's symbolism has evolved. It continues to represent the conflict between civilization and the wild, between safety and peril, and between surface appearances and hidden realities.
          <br><br>
          Even today, the Manananggal is deeply woven into local traditions, ghost stories, and even religious festivities that focus on protection against evil spirits.
        </p>

        <h2>Modern Interpretation</h2>
        <p>
          In modern times, the <b>Manananggal</b> has found new life through popular media. From horror films to television series, the creature is often used to represent both literal and figurative "monsters" in society.
          <br><br>
          Filipino horror cinema frequently portrays the Manananggal as a central antagonist, with famous movies like "Manananggal sa Unit 23B" (2016) presenting a more humanized, sympathetic version of the creature, blending horror with drama and romance.
          <br><br>
          In literature, the Manananggal is sometimes reimagined as a tragic figure—someone cursed or struggling against their monstrous nature. Graphic novels, webtoons, and modern stories blend traditional depictions with new elements, such as giving the creature modern-day struggles or placing it in urban settings.
          <br><br>
          Video games and digital media have also embraced the Manananggal, allowing players to either battle or play as such a creature. The creature's frightening image is often utilized in Filipino-designed horror games, showcasing its cultural significance even to new generations.
          <br><br>
          Through these various adaptations, the Manananggal remains a powerful symbol of duality: beauty and horror, human and monster, freedom and curse.
