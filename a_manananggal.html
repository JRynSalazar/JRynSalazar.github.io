    <h2>Origin</h2>
    <p>
      The <b>Manananggal</b> is one of the most terrifying and iconic creatures in Philippine folklore. The term "manananggal" is derived from the Tagalog word "tanggal," meaning "to separate" or "to remove," referencing the creature's ability to detach its upper torso from its lower body to fly into the night and prey upon unsuspecting victims. <br><br>
      This fearsome being is often depicted as a woman with bat-like wings, sharp fangs, and a gaping maw that thirsts for blood — especially that of pregnant women. Believed to originate from a mixture of indigenous animistic beliefs and Spanish colonial influences on demonology and witchcraft, stories of the Manananggal have been passed down orally through generations, particularly in the Visayan regions of the Philippines. <br><br>
      Historical accounts from Spanish friars and early missionaries noted the widespread belief in vampiric and ghoul-like entities across the islands. Over time, the Manananggal emerged as a uniquely Filipino interpretation of these dark forces, symbolizing fears surrounding death, disease, and the dangers of the night.

    <h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
    <p>
      In Filipino culture, the Manananggal is more than just a monster; it embodies deep societal anxieties about survival, health, and the unknown. The creature's association with pregnancy — a sacred and vulnerable state — reflects fears of mortality and the fragility of life in ancient and rural communities. <br><br>
      Manananggal legends were often told as cautionary tales, especially to pregnant women and young children, warning them against wandering at night or trusting strangers. The creature also represents the duality of appearances — someone who seems ordinary by day but harbors monstrous intentions by night — reflecting social fears about betrayal and hidden dangers within one's own community. <br><br>
      Folklore suggested that manananggals could be repelled or killed through traditional methods: by sprinkling salt or ash onto the creature's severed lower body, preventing it from reattaching and thus dooming it to perish by sunrise. Such stories reinforced the value of vigilance, community protection, and belief in the unseen forces surrounding daily life. <br><br>
      Today, the Manananggal remains a potent symbol in Filipino horror stories, films, and popular media, bridging the gap between ancient fears and modern fascination with the supernatural.

    <h2>Modern Interpretation</h2>
    <p>
      In modern times, the Manananggal continues to haunt Filipino imagination, but with new layers of interpretation. No longer merely a figure of terror, it is often explored as a symbol of female empowerment, societal marginalization, and even as a metaphor for inner struggles and dual identities. <br><br>
      In literature and cinema, manananggals have been portrayed both as villains and as tragic figures, cursed to live between two worlds — human and monster. Films like "Manananggal in Manila" and shows such as "Trese" have reimagined the creature in urban settings, blending ancient folklore with contemporary issues like alienation and transformation. <br><br>
      The Manananggal has also found its place in comic books, video games, and digital art, often depicted with intricate, terrifying designs that emphasize its eerie beauty and lethal nature. Artists and writers continue to reinterpret the creature to reflect changing cultural values, from horror to psychological drama. <br><br>
      Even today, stories persist from rural communities claiming sightings of winged creatures at night, suggesting that while the Manananggal has evolved in pop culture, its roots in Philippine consciousness remain deep and enduring. It serves as a powerful reminder that ancient fears still lurk beneath the surface of modern life, embodied by the shadowy figure that flies beneath the full moon.
