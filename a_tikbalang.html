    <h2>Origin</h2>
    <p>
      As horses weren't native to the Philippines in the pre-Spanish era, the earliest written records about the tikbalang did not specify horse or animal morphology. <br><br>
      Documents from Spanish friars such as Juan de Plasencia's Customs of the Tagalogs (1589) describe the tikbalang as ghosts and spirits of the forests, associated with the terms multo and bibit. <br> <br>
      Entries in early Spanish-Tagalog dictionaries defined tigbalang as "fantasma de montes" (phantoms of the mountains/wilds), linking them strongly as nature spirits. <br><br>
      An offensive expression "tigbalang ca mandin!(You are a wild beast!)" was used by early Tagalogs to signify one as uncouth and uncivilized. <br><br>
      There were also ghosts, which they called vibit; and phantoms, which they called 'Tigbalaang'. <br> <br>
      — Customs of the Tagalogs (1589), Juan de Plasencia <br><br>
      <i> The tigbalang is another object of which they stand in great awe. It is described as a phantom, which assumes a variety of uncouth and monstrous shapes, and interposes its authority, to prevent their performing the duties, prescribed by our religion. 
      <br>— Estadismo (1803),  Martinez de Zuniga <br><br></i>
      In historical dictionaries (San Buenaventura's 1613 Vocabulario spelled as "tigbalang"), they were likened to the tiyanac, while in some entries they were given the definition as "satyrs" (satiro), "gnomes" (duendes) or "goblins" (trasgo). 
      <br><br>
      <b>Horse-like appearance</b>
      <br><br>
      Later on, as horses were brought from China and Japan through the Spanish colonial government, accounts of the tikbalang appearing horse-like slowly became the norm. <br><br>
      Juan Francisco de San Antonio's Cronicas(1738-1744) describes the tikbalang as a malevolent entity living in the mountains, able to shapeshift into a variety of forms, including horses. <br><br>
      450. They greatly fear and reverence the tigbàlang or bibit. This is a ghost, goblin, or devil; and as it knows the cowardice of these Indians, it has been wont to appear to them in the mountains—now in the guise of an old man, telling them that he is their nono; now as a horse; and now as a monster. Consequently, the Indians in their terror make various pacts with it, and trade their rosaries for various articles of superstitious value, such as hairs, grass, stones, and other things, in order to obtain all their intents and free themselves from all the dangers. Thus do they live in delusion until God wills that the evangelical ministers undeceive them, which costs no little [effort], because of the very great fear with which they are filled. <br>
      <br>
      — Cronicas (1738–44), Juan Francisco de San Antonio
      <br><br>
      However, the very first document to actually describe the tikbalang as specifically having the appearance of a werehorse as it is more commonly known is Juan José Delgado's Biblioteca Histórica Filipina (orig. c. 1750). <br><br>
      Delgado recounts an alleged incident wherein a young boy from the town of San Mateo, after having escaped an attempted abduction by the tikbalang, described the creature as follows: <br><br>
      a very tall and skinny black man, with a long face like a horse, the shins of his legs reaching above his head when squatting down...(he had) very long ears and nose and somewhat short horns on his forehead, very large and frightening eyes, and the mouth of a horse. <br><br>
      Delgado also mentions the name "unglo" being used by the Visayans to refer to the same creature as the tikbalang.

    <h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
    <p>
      The <b>Tikbalang</b> is deeply rooted in Filipino folklore and holds a significant place in the cultural imagination of the Philippines. As a mythical creature, it represents not just a figure of terror, but also a symbol of the mysterious forces of nature and the complexities of the human spirit. While Tikbalang stories vary across different regions in the country, they all share common themes of trickery, fear, and reverence for the unknown.
      <br><br>
      Historically, the Tikbalang is often associated with rural life, especially in the mountains and forests where it is said to dwell. Farmers, travelers, and people living in remote areas would commonly encounter tales of the Tikbalang's mischief. It was believed that the Tikbalang would often lead people astray in the wilderness, causing them to lose their way or suffer misfortune. This made it an important figure in local superstitions, particularly those associated with nature and the environment.
      <br><br>
      The Tikbalang was also seen as a symbol of the power and unpredictability of the natural world. Its ability to shapeshift, often taking the form of a horse or other animals, reflects the ancient belief in animism, where animals, spirits, and the environment were interconnected. The creature's horse-like appearance, combined with its trickster behavior, made it a figure of both fear and fascination.
      <br><br>
      In Filipino culture, the Tikbalang also represents the concept of balance between the known and the unknown. Its mysterious nature, often described as both dangerous and elusive, underscores the tension between humanity's desire to understand the world and the recognition that some forces are beyond control. This tension is reflected in the way the Tikbalang is viewed by different communities—sometimes as an evil spirit, and other times as a protector or guide, depending on how one interacts with it.
      <br><br>
      Moreover, the Tikbalang's significance extends beyond folklore and into contemporary media, where it is often depicted in literature, films, and comics. These modern interpretations have transformed the creature from a figure of fear into one of intrigue, allowing new generations to engage with the myth in various ways. The Tikbalang's cultural relevance today is a testament to its enduring legacy in Filipino culture, as it continues to inspire stories, art, and even discussions about the supernatural and the human condition.
      <br><br>
      In essence, the Tikbalang is not just a creature from folklore—it is a cultural symbol that embodies the relationship between humans and nature, the known and the unknown, and the continuous evolution of traditional myths into modern cultural expressions.

    <h2>Modern Interpretation</h2>
    <p>
      In the modern world, the Tikbalang has transcended its role as a mere mythological figure to become a versatile symbol in Filipino culture and beyond. While its roots are firmly planted in traditional folklore, the Tikbalang has been reimagined in numerous contemporary forms, reflecting its enduring relevance in popular culture. From literature and movies to video games and graphic novels, the Tikbalang has evolved into a multifaceted character that captures the imagination of both young and old.
      <br><br>
      In literature, the Tikbalang is often portrayed as a creature that embodies the clash between the old and the new. Contemporary Filipino authors have reinterpreted the Tikbalang as both an antagonist and a complex anti-hero, exploring themes of power, rebellion, and the supernatural in modern society. The creature’s trickster nature, once feared for leading travelers astray, now symbolizes the unpredictable forces of modern life, such as societal changes, technological advances, and the breaking of traditional boundaries.
      <br><br>
      In film and television, the Tikbalang has been depicted in various genres, from horror to fantasy to action. It often appears as a dark, mysterious entity lurking in the shadows, a character that challenges the protagonists in both physical and psychological ways. Its portrayal has shifted from a purely malevolent spirit to a more nuanced figure—sometimes a protector of nature, sometimes an unpredictable force that tests human resilience. Notable films like Ang Panday (2009) and TV series like The Haunted have featured the Tikbalang in diverse roles, from villain to misunderstood creature, adding depth to the way it is perceived by modern audiences.
      <br><br>
      In graphic novels and comics, the Tikbalang has been depicted in both traditional and modernized styles. Artists have reimagined the creature with a more fantastical, often fierce appearance, blending traditional Filipino aesthetics with contemporary art techniques. The Tikbalang has also been reinterpreted as part of a larger supernatural world where it interacts with other mythological creatures, such as the Aswang, Kapre, and Tiyanak. This blending of folklore with modern fantasy has helped elevate the Tikbalang to iconic status in Filipino pop culture.
      <br><br>
      Moreover, the Tikbalang has found its place in digital media and video games. In virtual worlds, the Tikbalang is often depicted as an antagonist in role-playing games (RPGs) or as a character to be battled. The interactive nature of video games has allowed players to engage with the myth in new ways, presenting the Tikbalang as a creature to be outsmarted or defeated. In games like Mga Alamat ng Pilipinas and Sipa, the Tikbalang appears as a challenge for players, making it a character that embodies the tension between the ancient and the contemporary in a highly interactive form.
      <br><br>
      Even in modern-day superstitions, some Filipinos still hold on to the belief that the Tikbalang can cause mischief or lead people astray, especially in rural areas. The modern Tikbalang has thus become a fusion of old beliefs and new media, with some even claiming to have encountered the creature in the wilderness. These reports add to the mystique of the Tikbalang, keeping it alive in the collective consciousness of the Filipino people.
      <br><br>
      In essence, the modern interpretation of the Tikbalang reflects the adaptability of folklore to the changing times. While it remains rooted in its traditional origins, it has evolved into a character that speaks to contemporary themes of change, resistance, and the unknown. Through its various portrayals in literature, film, art, and digital media, the Tikbalang continues to inspire both fear and fascination, ensuring its place in the modern imagination.
